			<h2>Chapter 1: Introduction of Wireless Technologies </h2>

			Since the earliest times, man has found it essential to communicate with others. Developments in communications technology have always been driven by the need for information to be distributed in the shortest possible time. It may come as a surprise, but the earliest forms of communication were made by using wireless data technology. Long before the telephone was invented by Alexander Graham Bell in 1876, people were using wireless data communications. American Indians used smoke signals to communicate over long distances and messages could be passed along between a number of people spread over a considerable distance. Sailors were using semaphore with flags, or Morse code with signalling lanterns, to communicate between ships or to the shore. Long distance communications were accomplished by using carrier pigeons to deliver written messages. You can probably think of several other examples of wireless data which have been used in the past.
			<br/><br/>
			Communication using coded signals rather than voice was still the only method of sending information over long distance telegraph wires prior to the invention of the telephone. Morse code allowed normally written characters and symbols to be transmitted over copper wires for the first time. The first practical radio communication was demonstrated by Gugielmi Marconi when he made the first transatlantic wireless communication in 1901 using Morse code to transmit messages. Voice communication over wires had been around for many years, but Morse code was the only radio communication method until 1904 when a demonstration of voice broadcasting was made at the St. Louis Worlds Fair. Morse code is still used occasionally for long distance communications to ships at sea and by amateur radio enthusiasts.
			<br/><br/>
			For the purposes of this book, we can define wireless communication as any form of communication without using wires (or fiber optic cable). Data communication means transmitting information that is not in the form of speech. Radio (or radio frequency) is the part of the electromagnetic spectrum that has a frequency lower than that of infrared light. The advent of computer communications has changed our perception of data communications from thinking of Morse Code operating at one character per second over relatively short distances to the very high-speed data links of thousands or millions of bits of information per second over tremendous spans of geography. The data transmitted can represent many different types of information including multiple voice channels, full-motion video and computer data. The most common use of radio data communication today is the microwave link, which provides high-speed communications without underground or overhead cables and is a primary mechanism for carrying long-distance voice traffic.
			<br/><br/>
			Voice communications over radio has moved into the public domain with the rapid spread of cellular telephone technology in many countries of the world. Anyone with a cellular phone can now stay in touch with people while traveling, or even just away from their normal telephone. Parallel to these developments in wireless technology, the power of personal computing has brought high-speed data processing ability to the desktop. New applications have made PC users more productive; new lightweight and inexpensive portable PCs allow users to take their information and tools with them. The need to share information and resources among personal computer users has spawned the spread of local area networks (LANs), which in turn have required wire-based connections. The use of copper wires limits user flexibility to move freely within the office environment. Growth in client/server applications has made unfettered connectivity between workstations and other network resources very attractive.
			<br/><br/>
			The marriage of wireless communications and mobile computing will transform the way we do business. The convergence of hardware, software, communications and wireless technologies will ensure that information and services will be available to computer users at all times, in all places. Many different wireless communication technologies currently support hundreds of services. Cellular and cordless phones, pagers, portable computers, mobile radio units, and vehicle tracking units all use a wide range of protocols and transport options. Future portable products such as Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs) or Personal Intelligent Communicators (PICs) will combine separate voice and data functions in compact portable packages. The communications technologies will provide a choice of communications methods with several wired and wireless options available in a single device, automatically selected for the most appropriate method according to the kind of information transfer required, the physical location of the device, and the needs of the user.
