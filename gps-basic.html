<h3>6.4	 GPS Application Example and Programming</h3>

<h4>6.4.1	Basic Concept of GPS</h4>

<img src="gps-virtual.gif" alt="simulate"/>
<br/><br/>
A visual example of the GPS constellation in motion with the Earth rotating. Notice how the number of satellites in view from a given point on the Earth's surface, in this example at 45<sup>o</sup>N, changes with time.
<br/><br/>
<h3>The NMEA 0183 Standard</h3>
GPS devices usually produce positional information to the NMEA 0183 standard. This is a text-based standard that outputs lines of data-each line is known as a sentence. The device sends out these sentences continuously. The standard specifies that data should be transmitted at 4800 Baud, but many devices can select transmission speeds. You can find a sample output file from a Garmin GPS 48 on the CDROM in the file \GPS\output.txt. Here is sample output from a Garmin GPS 48 device:
<br/>

</pre>
Each sentence starts with a "$" sign followed by a sentence identifier. The first two letters in the identifier are the "talker id," which identifies the device producing the information. In the above example "GP" indicates that the data is from a GPS device, and "PG" indicates a proprietary sentence from Garmin. Each data item in a sentence is separated with a comma, and data items can be empty (indicated by two adjacent commas). Some sentences finish with a "*" followed by a number. This is a checksum which is an exclusive OR checksum on all characters in the message between, but not including, the "$" and "*". The checksum is displayed in hexadecimal-it is optional for some sentences and mandatory for others.
<br/><br/>
The code presented in this chapter describes how to interpret the "RMC" sentence-the recommended minimum specific GPS/Transit data. You can find out more about the NMEA standard and the structure of other sentences at <a href="http://vancouver-webpages.com/peter">http://vancouver-webpages.com/peter</a>, a website maintained by Peter Bennett. The "RMC" sentence provides basic navigational and time information including the following:
<br/>
<ul>
<li>Latitude and longitude</li>
<li>Time accurate to a second and a date</li>
<li>Speed in knots</li>
<li>Course made good (in degrees)</li>
<li>Magnetic variation (in degrees east or west)</li>
</ul>
<br/>
The following is an RMC sentence recording in Dublin, Ireland:
<pre>
$GPRMC,195531,A,5326.986,N,00610.147,W,000.0,360.0,170500,007.2,W*7F
</pre>
The fields in this sentence are described in Table :<br/>
<h3>Table : Structure of the RMC EMEA sentence</h3>
<table>
<tr class="t-header">
<td>Data</td><td>Purpose</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>$GPRMC</td><td>Talker ID (GP) and sentence identifier (RMC).</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>195531</td><td>Time when sentence was created in hhmmss format using 24-hour notation. This time is 19:55:31.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>A</td><td>Navigation receiver warning. A = OK, V = warning. A warning is usually given if satellite reception is poor or insufficient satellites are visible.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>5326.986</td><td>Current latitude showing degrees between 0 and 90, minutes, and a fraction of a minute. In this case the latitude is 53 degrees, 26 minutes, and 1/986 of a minute.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>N</td><td>Indicates whether latitude is north or south of the equator.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>00610.147</td><td>Longitude showing degrees between 0 and 180, minutes, and a fraction of a minute. In this case the longitude is 006 degrees, 10 minutes, and 1/147 of a minute.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>W</td><td>Indicates whether the longitude is west or east of the Greenwich meridian.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>000.0</td><td>Speed over the ground in knots. A knot is one nautical mile per hour, and a nautical mile is one minute of latitude. In this case the speed was zero knots.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>360.0</td><td>Course made good. Since the GPS unit was not moving, the course should be ignored but is reported as 360 degrees.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>170500</td><td>Date in the form ddmmyy. This date is 17May2000.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>007.2</td><td>Magnetic variation. This is the difference, expressed in degrees, between the magnetic north pole and the true north pole. This varies around the world and over time. In Dublin on this date the magnetic variation is 7.2 degrees.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>W</td><td>Indicates whether the magnetic pole is to the west or east of the true pole.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>*7F</td><td>Checksum expressed as a hexadecimal value.</td>
</tr>

Figure: shows sample output from the code described in this chapter for an RMC sentence, including using the checksum. The checksum is important in navigational applications.
